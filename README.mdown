## Description:
This script aims to help you to backup your entirely your website through and incremental copy and making
a daily tarball. To preserve the space disk and avoid useless backups, the oldest backups (e.g: older than 30days)
will be erased at the end of the batch.It is also possible to make a dump of your database (MySql).

## Prerequisites :
To be able to join the remote server and copy you have to be connected via ssh without having
to key any password, you have to generate a couple key without passphrase to avoid password identification.

* `ssh-keygen -t dsa; no passphrase`
* `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub root@host`

2. This script is using rsync so rsync has to be installed on the remote server: `apt-get install rsync`

## How to :
There aro some variables in `bachup.sh` that you have to set up :
* set SITE (this is the global path of your website)
* set sitename (this is the name's directory to backup)
* set bdd_name
* Fill on your remote server the data base information: `vi /root/.my.cnf`
* set datelimit to clean the oldest backups

## Usage:
- $PROGNAME [-s] "login@host" [-d|--dest] "/dir/to/save"
- $PROGNAME [-b] [-s] "login@host" [-d|--dest] "/dir/to/save"

## Cron
This may useful to put this script as cron task :
`20 07 * * 1 /path/backup.sh -b -s root@remotehost -d /local/path/to/save/` #mysqldump
`22 07 * * 1 /path/to/backup.sh -s root@remotehost -d /local/path/to/save/` #backup your website
